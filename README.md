# NextJS Boilerplate

I use this boilerplate as a starting point for all my React projects, feel free to use it if you find it convenient/useful.

This config supports the SSR feature provided by NextJS.

## Configuration List

- Basic NextJS installation
- Semantic UI custom source (run `yarn build-semantic` to build a bundle into `/static`)
- Styled Components
- Airbnb eslint config

## Install

```
$ yarn
$ yarn build-semantic
```

## Usage

```
$ yarn dev
```
